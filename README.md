I'm Jingyang (Steven) Zhang, a Research Scientist at [Virtue AI](https://www.virtueai.com/). I currently focus on developing the lastest multi-modal LLMs. Previously I got my Ph.D. from Duke University in 2024 (supervised by Prof. Yiran Chen and Prof. Hai (Helen) Li) and Bachelor degree from Tsinghua University in 2019.

See my [personal webpage](https://zjysteven.github.io) to know more about me and my Ph.D. research.
